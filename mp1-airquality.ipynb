    "# Mini project 1: air quality in U.S. cities\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, this project is simple: you are given some data on air quality in U.S. metropolitan areas over time together with several questions of interest, and your objective is to answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike the homeworks and labs, there is no explicit instruction provided about *how* to answer the questions or where exactly to begin. Thus, you will need to discern for yourself how to manipulate and summarize the data in order to answer the questions of interest, and you will need to write your own codes from scratch to obtain results. It is recommended that you examine the data, consider the questions, and plan a rough approach before you begin doing any computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have some latitude for creativity: **although there are accurate answers to each question** -- namely, those that are consistent with the data -- **there is no singularly correct answer**. Most students will perform similar operations and obtain similar answers, but there's no specific result that must be considered to answer the questions accurately. As a result, your approaches and answers may differ from those of your classmates. If you choose to discuss your work with others, you may even find that disagreements prove to be fertile learning opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions can be answered using computing skills taught in class so far and basic internet searches for domain background; for this project, you may wish to refer to HW1 and Lab1 for code examples and the [EPA website on PM pollution](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution) for background. However, you are also encouraged to refer to external resources (package documentation, vignettes, stackexchange, internet searches, etc.) as needed -- this may be an especially good idea if you find yourself thinking, 'it would be really handy to do X, but I haven't seen that in class anywhere'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broader goal of these mini projects is to cultivate your problem-solving ability in an unstructured setting. Your work will be evaluated based on the following:\n",
    "- choice of method(s) used to answer questions;\n",
    "- clarity of presentation;\n",
    "- code style and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write up your results separately from your codes; codes should be included at the end of the notebook.\n",

    "The CBSA is a short form of core-based statistical area which is a U.S. geographic area defined by the Office of Management and Budget. The measure standard is based on that certain area consists of one or more counties anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people andadjcent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting. In the given data, there are total 351 CBSAs included which is one third of the total CBSA in United States. All of the CBSA given in the data sets are located in 86 different states and territories. The data set only provided the data from 2000 to 2019 which means the data is recorded during 2020. There are total 17340 observations were recorded in the data. In addition, there are 12 variables are measured in the data in order to provide useful information. According to the data set, only the name of Core-based statistical area, CBSA code, Year, and Pollutant is non-missing most of the time.\n",

    "PM2.5 is stands fine particulate matter and PM2.5 are little particles in the air that lessen perceivability and influence the air to seem cloudy when levels are raised.In order words, the term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), alludes to minuscule particles or beads in the air that are two and one half microns or less in width.The widths of the bigger particles in the PM2.5 size reach would be multiple times less than that of a human hair. PM2.5 is harmful to human because particles in the PM2.5 size range can travel profoundly into the respiratory plot, arriving at the lungs. Openness to fine particles can cause transient wellbeing impacts like eye, nose, throat, and lung bothering, hacking, sniffling, runny nose, and windedness. Openness to fine particles can likewise influence lung work and deteriorate ailments like asthma and coronary illness. Logical examinations have connected expansions in everyday PM2.5 openness with expanded respiratory and cardiovascular clinic affirmations, crisis division visits, and passings."

    "\n",
    "Yes, PM2.5 air pollution has been improved in the U.S. on the whole since 2000. I first made a summary with the null variables on observation with PM2.5 and found out that the 4th Max and 98th Percentile are the best trend statistic to determine whether the data is improving or not because they do not have any null values. Then I created a data set with only the year and the result of certain statistical tests. In addition, we are looking for the total trend of the United States so the area name is not important for us to know. Second, I made two charts showing both the 4th Max and 98th Percentile with a boxplot. In order words, the boxplot can tell they mean point of that area and we can easily find out that the PM2.5 is decreasing. And 2019's United States PM2.5 mean is lower than what we had in 2000. I also drew a mean line in both graphs to make a better comparison. So as a result, the PM2.5 pollution has been improved in the U.S. since 2000."

And almost every year the difference between maximum and minimum is 7 or more. In order words, the maximum city and the minimum city are having totally different environments or air quality.
